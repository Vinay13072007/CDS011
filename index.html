    <h1>Water Logging</h1>
    <p>Waterlogging occurs when there is too much water in a plantâ€™s root zone, which decreases the oxygen available to roots. Waterlogging can be a major constraint to plant growth and production and, under certain conditions, will cause plant death. This constraint may not be apparent until the whole soil profile is saturated and water appears on the surface. The department provides landholders with technical information and support on management options to recognise and reduce the impacts of waterlogging.</p>
